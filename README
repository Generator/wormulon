wormulon 0.1.4
Hendrik Scholz - hscholz@raisdorf.net - http://www.raisdorf.net/

wormulon is based on slurm (http://www.raisdorf.net/slurm/) and adds
a traffic statistic to your screen hardstatus line.
wormulon has its own website on http://www.raisdorf.net/wormulon/

Just ./configure && make
make install isn't available as of now.

Since wormulon was born in a car on the way back from Linuxtag to Kiel
I couldn't test it on a large variety of systems and only FreeBSD and Linux
are (somewhat) supported. Since slurm supports *BSD, Linux, Solaris and HPUX
support will be added soon.
UPDATE: Now *BSD, Linux and Solaris are supported. HPUX has to be tested.

C O N F I G U R E

screen has to be configured to use wormulon, so add atleast this to your
~/.screenrc:

backtick 1 0 0 /path/to/wormulon -i fxp0
hardstatus alwayslastline "%{bw}%1`%= "

The webite has some more detailed information available.

Comments and contributions are very welcome. Please ask first before
implementing any features and sending diffs since the interal structure may
(and will) change rendering your patches useless.

I'll put up a page showing the list of TODO-features in the meanwhile have a
look at the TODO file.
